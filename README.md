# Skip List
### This was my attempt at building an ascending order, sorted skip list using C language.  
The whole idea behind this data structure is to create "fast lanes", which speed up the element searching process, through the use of pointer arrays and a randomization function, e.g. a "coin toss", to decide the level of each "lane".
