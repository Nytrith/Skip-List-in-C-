# Skip-List-in-C
This was my attempt at building an ADT - Ascending Order Sorted Skip List in C.
The whole idea behind this data structure is to create "fast lanes", to search elements, through the use of pointer arrays and a randomization function, almost like tossing a coin, to decide the level of each "lane".
My code is commented in portuguese.
