# Skip-List-in-C
### This was my attempt at building an ADT - Ascending Order Sorted Skip List in C.  
The whole idea behind this data structure is to create "fast lanes", which speed up the element searching process, through the use of pointer arrays and a randomization function, like a "coin toss", to decide the level of each "lane".
